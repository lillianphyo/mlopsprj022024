# Rice Price Forecasting

Rice price forecasting is critical for Myanmar’s economy, especially in key cities like Yangon and Mandalay. The goal is to predict rice prices accurately, considering market dynamics, historical data, and external factors. We’ll leverage Machine Learning (ML) techniques, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, to achieve this. Additionally, we’ll implement MLOps practices to streamline the development and deployment process.

## Key Components

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing** :

   * Gather historical data on rice prices in Yangon and Mandalay.
   * Include relevant features such as weather data, production levels, and import/export statistics.
   * Clean and preprocess the data for model training.
2. Feature Engineering:

   * Create meaningful features from raw data:
     * Lagged prices (previous day/week prices).
     * Seasonal indicators (time of year, monsoon season, etc.).
     * Economic indicators (exchange rates, inflation, etc.).
3. Model Selection and Training:

   * Utilize LSTM networks for time series forecasting.
   * Split data into training and validation sets.
   * Tune hyperparameters (e.g., hidden units, learning rate).
4. MLOps Integration:

   * **Grafana** : Set up monitoring dashboards to visualize model performance and data trends.
   * **Docker** : Containerize the LSTM model for consistent deployment across environments.
   * **Python Unit Tests** : Develop robust unit tests to validate model functionality.
   * **S3** : Store historical data and model artifacts securely.
   * **MLflow** : Track experiments, manage model versions, and facilitate collaboration.
5. Challenges:

   * **Limited Data Availability** : Myanmar’s rice market data may be sparse or incomplete.
   * **External Factors** : Political instability, trade policies, and climate change can impact prices.

| V008 | geo_id            | Market location identifier | The geo_id variable serves as a unique identifier for each market location in the RTP datasets, derived from geographic coordinates.<br />This identifier is essential for accurately linking market price data to specific geographical locations. <br />It ensures precise tracking and comparison of prices across different areas and is particularly useful for spatial analysis and mapping trends geographically. <br />The uniqueness of each geo_id aids in the clear distinction and aggregation of data by location, making it a key element in any geographical or location-based analysis of market prices. <br />The geo_id is shared across Real Time Food Prices (RTFP), Real Time Energy Prices (RTEP) and Real Time Exchange Rates (RTFP) that share the same timestamp (RTP data are generated weekly, they share the same timestamp when they are in the same week). <br />The geo_id may be used to link data sets from different time periods, but caution is recommended. <br />Use also the mkt_name field and Longitude and Latitude to obtain a better understanding of the market location, while noting that market names may change over time, market names may be shared between multiple locations, or multiple markets may share similar coordinates. |

|      | inflation_rice    |                            | inflation_rice provides the 12-month inflation rate, or price change rate, for commodity rice.<br />This metric is calculated by comparing the current price against the price from 12 months prior, giving an annualized percentage change. <br />Inflation rates are crucial economic indicators, reflecting the purchasing power and cost of living changes. <br />For a more comprehensive understanding of overall inflation, analyzing a basket of food items rather than single commodities is recommended, as it offers a broader perspective of general price trends. <br />This data is instrumental in economic planning, policy making, and understanding the macroeconomic environment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|      | trust_rice        |                            | trust_rice offers a trust score, ranging from 1-10, reflecting the reliability of the inflation calculation for rice.<br />These scores are specific to each market, time period, and commodity, considering the data availability and accuracy for the preceding 12 months. <br />Higher scores indicate greater confidence and robustness in the inflation figures, based on the quality and quantity of data used and the cross-validated accuracy of imputed data. <br />This score is key for users to assess the credibility and dependability of the inflation data, aiding in more informed economic and financial analysis. A score of 10 corresponds to an entry for which up to 12 months of preceding data has been fully observed. <br />Values below 6 highlight observations generated with extremely low confidence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
